Following a tragic bus crash that claimed the lives of 15 students, Saarani emphasized the need for reassessing the alignment and widening of the JRTB. 'The upgrade involves more than just resurfacing; it requires a full reconstruction,' he stated during a press conference after officiating the closing ceremony of the 2025 National Training Week in Ipoh. The state government has tasked officials with preparing reports on these upgrades, which will be submitted to relevant ministries.<a href='https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2025/06/21/after-deadly-bus-crash-perak-mb-urges-federal-support-for-east-west-highway-and-gerik-hospital-upgrades-in-13mp/181191'>[1]</a>",

Bruce Mabley, a retired diplomat, remarked, 'It's stupid not to be there.' Despite having an embassy in Israel, Canada severed ties with Iran over a decade ago. This absence impacts Ottawa's ability to provide direct support to thousands of Canadian citizens in Iran. Observers note that while having an embassy would offer advantages, there are limits to what can be achieved amidst such chaos.<a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-emergency-canada-no-embassy-1.7567370?cmp=rss'>[2]</a>",
