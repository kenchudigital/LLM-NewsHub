      "title": "After deadly bus crash, Perak MB urges federal support for East-West Highway and Gerik Hospital upgrades in 13MP",
      "content": "IPOH, June 21 — Perak Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad has expressed hope that the proposal to upgrade the East-West Highway (JRTB) linking Gerik and Jeli will be included in the 13th Malaysia Plan (13MP).\n\nSaarani said the state government had conveyed its intention to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during his visit to Lumut last week.\n\n“What’s most important is to reassess the alignment and widening of the JRTB. The upgrade involves more than just resurfacing; it requires a full reconstruction, as the existing structure is so old that some of the damage has exposed the road base.\n\n“This highway has been in use for over 40 years, and simply patching up damaged sections may no longer be sufficient. However, the state government fully understands that constructing a new alignment or rebuilding the JRTB would require substantial funding,” he said at a press conference after officiating the closing ceremony of the 2025 National Training Week at the Ipoh Convention Centre here today.\n\nSaarani said the state government has also instructed the State Infrastructure, Energy, Water and Public Transport chairman, Datuk Seri Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin, and Human Resources, Health, Indian Community Affairs and National Integration chairman A. Sivanesan, to prepare a report and study on upgrading the JRTB and Gerik Hospital.\n\n“Mohammad Nizar will obtain information and data from the Works Ministry regarding the upgrade of the JRTB, while Sivanesan is working on applying to the Health Ministry for the upgrading of Gerik Hospital, as there is an urgent need in the event of accidents. Typically, victims are taken to Hospital Taiping or the Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital.\n\n“If upgraded, it would be sufficient for patients or victims to be treated at Gerik Hospital, provided it is equipped with the necessary facilities and expertise. Once the study is completed, we will submit a letter to the relevant ministry,” he added.\n\nIn the early hours of June 9, a tragic accident along the JRTB near Tasik Banding, Gerik, claimed the lives of 15 Universiti Perguruan Sultan Idris (UPSI) students when the chartered bus transporting them from Jertih, Terengganu, to the main campus in Tanjong Malim, Perak, was involved in a crash.\n\nThe crash also left 33 others injured, including the bus driver and his assistant, as well as the driver and three passengers of a multi-purpose vehicle. — Bernama",

      "title": "With no embassy in Tehran, Canada reacts to turmoil in Iran from afar",
      "content": "While an embassy presence would have advantages, observers say there are limits to what's possible\n\nNeither Israel nor Iran is backing down from an escalating conflict that has endangered civilians in both countries, and because Canada has no embassy in Iran, Ottawa is having to work from afar to support thousands of Canadian citizens stuck there.\n\nWhile Canada has an embassy in Israel, it severed diplomatic relations with Tehran more than a decade ago.\n\nThough having an embassy presence would provide Canada with certain advantages, analysts and observers say there are limits in what can be done on the ground with so much chaos unfolding.\n\nThat said, Bruce Mabley, a retired diplomat whose postings included stints in the Middle East, says having a diplomatic presence at least allows both countries to potentially talk to one another.\n\n\"It's stupid not to be there,\" he said.\n\nA long way to the border\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada did not respond to questions from CBC News about how the lack of an embassy presence was impacting Ottawa's efforts to support Canadians inside Iran.\n\nBut even if Canada did have an embassy in Tehran right now, that wouldn't change the fact that flights aren't leaving the capital. Both Iran and Israel had closed their airspaces while launching numerous attacks over the last week, though Iran recently allowed an Indian flight to leave from another part of the country, and several more were reportedly expected to follow.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Anita Anand has publicly urged Canadians fleeing both Israel and Iran to head to Jordan, Armenia and Turkey.\n\nBut the journey to neighbouring nations of Turkey or Armenia is a long one for anyone living in the Iranian capital, which is hundreds of kilometres from either of those destinations.\n\n\"The border is really far away,\" said University of Toronto history professor Mohamad Tavakoli-Targhi, who was born in Tehran and has family still in Iran.\n\nHe says the roads out of the Iranian capital have been jammed with people trying to flee, making that route out more difficult.\n\nA tense journey\n\nOne of his students, Hanieh Bakhtiari, recently travelled back to Iran to visit her parents, and the fighting started days after she arrived.\n\nBakhtiari and her partner fled the country on a bus, in a tense, 11-hour journey to Turkey, during which she says she was \"constantly watching\" the skies for potential attacks.\n\n\"We were … very much scared of being attacked while we were on the road,\" said Bakhtiari, who spoke to CBC's As It Happens about her journey out of Iran.\n\nIsrael began a wave of attacks on June 13, targeting Iranian military and nuclear sites with airstrikes that have killed high-ranking Iranian generals and nuclear scientists.\n\nThe Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran says that as of Thursday, at least 657 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, and of those, at least 263 were civilians.\n\nIran has launched retaliatory strikes, which the Israeli military estimates have involved at least 450 missiles and 1,000 drones. At least two dozen people in Israel have been killed.\n\nThe Israeli push against Iran may draw U.S. involvement, though U.S. President Donald Trump has delayed making a decision.\n\nThe costs of cutting ties\n\nOpinions are split among observers on whether it would be better for Canada to have an embassy in Tehran.\n\n\"Having an embassy in Tehran would not be a panacea,\" said Peter G. Bates, a retired Canadian diplomat who was twice posted to Tehran and helped close the Canadian embassy there in 2012.\n\nPhil Gurski, a former Iran intelligence analyst for Canadian spy agencies, finds himself \"on both sides\" of the debate.\n\nOn one hand, he says there's a point where a line is crossed that cannot be tolerated, but when an embassy gets shut down and ties are cut, \"you're essentially flying blind.\"\n\nGurski says there are other ways for the government to monitor events in Iran — including reviewing information from satellites, the use of signals intelligence, or conferring with friendly embassies about what's unfolding on the ground.\n\nGurski, Mabley and Bates all note that when an embassy is closed, a government will typically ask an ally with an embassy presence in that same region to provide support in its absence.\n\nHowever, any friendly embassy doing favours for Canada will expectedly prioritize the needs of its own citizens first.\n\nAnd as things escalate between Israel and Iran, any such ally may also be getting similar requests from other nations that don't have a diplomatic presence in Tehran.\n\nU of T's Tavakoli-Targhi sees a clear benefit that an embassy provides, beyond giving diplomatic staff better access to citizens abroad.\n\nHe says embassies can serve as a source of hope for people who are \"in a moment of despair,\" like many Canadians living in Tehran at the moment.",

      "content": "Thiago Avila was on board the aid vessel Madleen when it was intercepted by Israel\n\nAfter four days in Israeli detention, Thiago Avila was relieved to be back in Brazil. He'd been taken into custody, along with 11 others, and spent two days in solitary confinement, after they'd tried to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza by sea. Their vessel, the Madleen, was intercepted leading to what he describes as a gruelling stay marked by inhumane treatment and a brief hunger strike.\n\nAnd yet, he told CBC News from Sao Paulo, he chose to be detained rather than sign documents admitting to what he considered a false accusation — that they had tried to enter Israel illegally.\n\nSome 20 hours after the vessel was intercepted, Avila, 37, says they were taken to shore and crammed into small police vehicles. He says they had not been given access to a bathroom and that one crew member urinated in the police car.\n\n\"It was a very degrading [situation],\" he said.\n\nIsraeli police did not respond to a request for comment on Avila's time in jail.\n\nThey were taken to an immigration facility, he says, where former officers of the Israel Defence Forces demanded he and the others — noted climate activist was Greta Thunberg among them — watch videos of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas against Israel, which sparked the latter's war in Gaza, and a humanitarian crisis therein.\n\nHe says they refused — unless the officer they were speaking to would watch videos of what is taking place in Gaza.\n\n\"I said 'If you don't watch the video of the genocide that you're committing, we don't want to watch the video that you are using to manufacture consent for your genocide,'\" he said.\n\nThe official refused, and the crew were not made to view the videos.\n\nHe says he was asked, again, by an immigration agent, to sign documents that said he'd entered Israel illegally. He would have been deported and banned from the country for 100 years if he signed. He again refused. Avila says the boat was in international waters when it was intercepted.\n\nBut the group agreed that some of them should sign so they could go out and tell the Madleen's story.\n\n\"We didn't want to have no other voice telling the truth about what happened,\" he said.\n\nFour signed and were freed.\n\nThe others were taken to Israel's Givon Prison and placed in separate cells. Avila says the conditions were terrible — little to no access to water, which was darkly coloured; bed bugs that he says led to Scabies; and psychological torment by sleep depravation.\n\n\"They would come every hour or so just to make noise, make everyone get up [and] not be able to sleep,\" he said.\n\nAvila says he was singled out for solitary confinement because he was one of the organizers of the mission and because he'd gone on a hunger and thirst strike.\n\nHe says officers told him that he'd be disciplined and offered him food on multiple occasions — bread, hummus and rice.\n\nAvila says he told them: \"Since you're... denying food to more than two million people in Gaza, how can I accept your food and water?\"\n\nFor months now, aid has all but trickled into Gaza since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was broken in March.

      "title": "‘A perfect storm’: multi-club ownership, Crystal Palace and a looming court threat",
      "content": "Uefa’s legal team is preparing for more action as a complex and increasingly common issue rears its head again\n\nIn the waterfront offices of Uefa’s House of European Football headquarters in Nyon, the legal team are preparing for an unwanted trip around Lake Geneva to Lausanne. Over the course of many internal meetings since Crystal Palace inadvertently provided Uefa with the toughest test yet of its multi-club ownership (MCO) rules by winning the FA Cup, it has become increasingly clear the ultimate arbiter on the issue is likely to be the court of arbitration for sport (Cas).\n\n“We’re going to find out if our MCO rules stand up to scrutiny as, one way or another, it looks like we’re going to Cas,” says one source at Uefa, resigned to the issue of whether Palace can compete in next season’s Europa League being placed in the hands of that Lausanne court.\n\nUefa has been liaising closely with Palace, with sources claiming the issue of John Textor’s dual shareholding in the club and Lyon – who qualified for the Europa League by finishing sixth in Ligue 1 – was flagged by the governing body long before the 1 March deadline for resolving MCO issues. The American is in advanced discussions over selling his 44.9% stake in Palace to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, which may help the club’s cause, although there is no prospect of the deal being completed before Uefa has to make a decision.\n\nThe case is emblematic of the confusion surrounding club ownership and the regulatory issues facing the sport, and Uefa has delayed a ruling until the related case of Lyon’s financial problems has been resolved. The DNCG – French football’s financial watchdog – is auditing Lyon’s accounts after imposing a provisional relegation to Ligue 2 last year owing to the club’s debt levels, with a final outcome expected next week. Relegation and a ban from European competition for Lyon would make Uefa’s life a lot easier, although both seem unlikely.\n\n“It’s a perfect storm,” says a sympathetic figure at another club. “Everything that could go wrong from Uefa’s point of view has done. We have three clubs involved [Palace, Lyon and Brøndby, who are owned by the Palace shareholder David Blitzer], and two multi-club groups. There’s a complex ownership group at Palace who don’t appear to communicate very well, and a surprise FA Cup winner. Not to mention Lyon’s financial issues. You couldn’t make it up really.”\n\nPalace sources acknowledge they are working with Uefa amid belief on both sides that an accommodation is wanted, but two factors beyond either party’s control could count against them.\n\nFirst, Cas last month upheld Fifa’s decision to expel the Mexican club León from the Club World Cup because they are part of the same ownership group as another qualifier, Pachuca. The owner, Grupo Pachuca, had attempted to park its León shareholding in a separate trust but this move did not satisfy Fifa or Cas.\n\nIn another complication Nottingham Forest, who will be moved from the Conference League to the Europa League if Palace are kicked out, may go to Cas if denied that promotion. A source close to Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, told the Guardian the Greek billionaire was opposed to many of the moves to regulate football and was prepared to take on Uefa. There are clear financial incentives to do so. Whereas Chelsea earned £21m in prize money from winning the Conference League in the past season, Tottenham’s Europa League triumph could be worth well over £100m because it also delivered a Champions League place.\n\nPalace are worried the León ruling has set a precedent that could work against them. At Uefa there is a feeling that it would rather face Forest at Cas than have its multi-club framework tested in court by Palace.\n\nOne figure at a European team with direct experience of multi-club contortions believes Uefa will give Palace every opportunity to pass muster, concurring that the governing body’s regulations could be brought tumbling down in the event Textor and company mounted a challenge. An examination brought about by Forest would, they suggested, give the existing rules a far better chance of holding firm.\n\nConfirmation by Cas this week of the League of Ireland side Drogheda’s expulsion from the Conference League owing to a multi-club breach has heightened concerns in Nyon, but the cases are different. Drogheda had qualified by winning the Irish Cup last November yet their owner, Trivela Group, failed to meet Uefa’s March deadline, and unlike Textor the American investors are majority owners of two clubs: Drogheda and Denmark’s Silkeborg.\n\nUefa had caused disquiet in some quarters by shifting that deadline forward from last year’s June date. Some figures involved in club acquisition have expressed surprise that Drogheda were not able to win their case at Cas.\n\n“Uefa are trying to be flexible, but the Fifa v Club León case is making it harder for them,” a source said. “Cas upheld Fifa’s rules, which are very similar to Uefa’s, so the precedent is there. The Cas ruling was based on the nature of the blind trust and the importance of the regulatory process – ie dates and deadlines. To put it simply Palace haven’t complied, but Uefa want to make it work.”\n\nThere is some acknowledgment at Uefa that elements of its MCO rules are not fit for purpose, although it would prefer to redraft them in Nyon than put them at the mercy of the court. There is nothing in Article 5 of Uefa’s rules detailing whether Palace or Brøndby should be given precedence if both end up in next season’s Conference League, for example. In ordinary circumstances it would be Brøndby by virtue of their higher league position, as stated in the rules, but Palace could also have a claim if parachuted in from the more prestigious Europa League.\n\nUefa’s MCO rules have been in place without many revisions for 24 years, although one significant change was made 12 months ago when the regulations were relaxed to permit a club part of a multi-ownership group to compete in a different competition.\n\nArticle 5 was drafted in 2001 after a legal challenge from Tottenham’s owner, Enic, the first multi-club operation in the Premier League, after AEK Athens were blocked from taking part in the 1998-99 Uefa Cup because their sister club Slavia Prague had also qualified. The initial rule stated that “control or influence” over more than one club was not allowed, but it was not tested until 2017 when RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg qualified for the Champions League, which led to the wording being altered to “decisive influence”.\n\nWhat had been a rare occurrence is now an annual problem for Uefa, with Aston Villa, Brighton and Toulouse allowed to play in Europe during the 2023-24 season only when their owners put more distance between them and Vitória de Guimarães, Union Saint-Gilloise and Milan respectively. The same issue affected Manchester City and Girona as well as Manchester United and Nice a year later.\n\nThe fact that neither Girona nor Manchester United joined their partner clubs in qualifying for next season’s European competitions may have kicked a further conundrum down the road. Their respective ownership groups were allowed what was, in theory, a short-term exemption last season by placing one of their clubs’ shares in a blind trust until 1 July this year. One club owner wonders how Uefa would have responded if those sides had reached the same tournament for a second consecutive year. It is unclear whether they would have been allowed to roll over into a further 12 months of blind trust holding.\n\nMulti-club ownership is growing constantly; figures shared with the Guardian by the MCO Insights consultancy suggest more than 800 top- and second-tier clubs could be involved by 2030. That would roughly double the current number. By that point it would surely be uncontrollable by current rules. Simon Leaf, head of sport at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, believes Uefa and other governing bodies need clearer regulations to avoid being repeatedly taken to court.\n\n“We are seeing an increasing number of clubs looking to use various legal avenues – in particular, competition law – to try to challenge regulations that they dislike,” Leaf says. “This trend is likely to continue, making it much harder for leagues and governing bodies to regulate their competitions.\n\n“On the Palace matter it is hard to have too much sympathy with Uefa given they already showed themselves to be willing to bend their own rules on MCOs last summer – and despite their efforts to strengthen the regulations since then, the bar has now been set.\n\n“Either way, MCOs are not going away, and so football’s governing bodies need to find a way to properly deal with these issues so that they are dealt with in the boardroom rather than the courtroom.”",

      "title": "Teen behind US$245m Bitcoin theft to testify against Singaporean ringleader Malone Lam",
      "content": "WASHINGTON, June 21 — A 19-year-old man who pleaded guilty to one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in US history has agreed to testify against Singaporean national Malone Lam, who is accused of masterminding a sprawling digital crime ring that stole over US$260 million.\n\nAccording to Channel News Asia, Veer Chetal admitted in a plea deal to conspiracy charges involving fraud and money laundering linked to the theft of 4,100 bitcoins from a Washington, DC, crypto holder in August 2024. The stolen coins were valued at around US$245 million (RM1 billion) at the time.\n\nUnsealed court documents revealed that Chetal agreed in November last year to cooperate with federal authorities and testify against his co-defendants, including 20-year-old Lam. Chetal, who was a Rutgers University student at the time, now faces up to 24 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Lam was not only involved in the US$245 million theft but allegedly spearheaded a 13-member criminal ring that operated globally, targeting crypto wallets using “social engineering” attacks. Members posed as tech support staff from companies like Google and Yahoo to trick victims into handing over access credentials.\n\nThe group is believed to have met on online gaming platforms, where they bonded before launching their sophisticated scheme. In May, Lam was charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act in connection with the wider conspiracy. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nFederal prosecutors describe Lam as one of the ring’s two leaders. Despite being arrested last September, he allegedly continued directing operations from jail — including instructing members to purchase and deliver luxury goods to his girlfriend in Miami.\n\nAuthorities say Lam personally benefited from the crimes, reportedly spending up to US$500,000 in a single night at clubs and amassing at least 28 luxury cars, some valued at US$3.8 million. He also rented high-end properties in Los Angeles, Miami, and the Hamptons, and spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing.\n\nLam’s lawyer, Scott Armstrong, has said the Singaporean “looks forward to exercising his right to trial by jury,” with proceedings set to begin in October.\n\nChetal’s guilty plea has brought further revelations. Prosecutors now allege he was linked to about 50 other crypto thefts totalling US$3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin theft, Chetal’s parents were kidnapped in a botched ransom plot in Connecticut by six men who believed he still controlled large amounts of cryptocurrency. The attack failed thanks to witnesses and an off-duty FBI agent nearby.\n\nThe teen’s assets, including over US$39 million in cryptocurrency, luxury watches, clothing, and US$500,000 in cash, have since been seized by federal agents. He is also facing possible deportation.",

      "title": "Iran is the enemy Netanyahu has always wanted to destroy. Even from their bomb shelters, most Israelis support his war",
      "content": "Within Israel, Iran is seen as the ultimate threat. The prime minister knows this is his chance to rewrite his bloodied legacy\n\n“It’s 1938 and Iran is Germany … The Jewish people will not allow a second Holocaust.” Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, recited slogans like these incessantly for decades, urging action against the gravest threat to the Jewish state – a nuclear-armed Iran. He conveyed the message to successive US presidents. He presented a bomb cartoon at the UN. At countless Holocaust memorial events he described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as the present-day “final solution”.\n\nNetanyahu talked and talked about the pressing Iranian threat, but his listeners were not convinced. They dismissed him as an alarmist whose deadline Iran crossed year after year without deploying a nuclear weapon (it still hasn’t). Netanyahu’s critics at home taunted him as a chicken who would never dare to attack Iran’s nuclear installations – unlike his more decisive predecessors, who had ordered the bombing of nuclear reactors in Iraq and Syria.\n\nEverything changed on Friday 13 June.\n\nAt 3am local time, Israelis were woken by an urgent alert from the Home Front Command, ordering us to stay near our safe rooms or bomb shelters. Shortly after, an official announcement told us that Israel had attacked Iran’s nuclear plants and air defences, and assassinated its top military brass and nuclear scientists. When the night came, a barrage of Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv and its outskirts. The exchanges of bombs, drones and missiles have continued ever since, causing more than 260 civilian deaths in Iran and 24 in Israel, and inflicting considerable damage.\n\nTo Netanyahu and his followers, 13 June is the big vindication. An opportunity to rewrite his legacy, which has been marred by his failure to prevent the disaster of 7 October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping 250 hostages to Gaza, and igniting a devastating war that is still going on. The prime minister ignored warnings of imminent war while pushing autocracy, then blamed the security services, spreading excuses and conspiracy theories only his diehard supporters believed.\n\nThe ensuing Gaza war did little to boost Netanyahu’s leadership credentials. Even after Israel had killed more than 55,000 Palestinians it failed to achieve the “ultimate victory” pledged by the prime minister. Hamas, however decimated, is still in charge, and 53 Israeli hostages – 20 of them believed to be alive – are still in captivity. To many around the world, Netanyahu’s name is synonymous with mass murder. Even in Israel, anti-war sentiment began to rise after he broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March.\n\nAttacking Iran, however, is far more consensual in Israel. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute released on Thursday showed 82% of Jewish respondents – including 57% who consider themselves leftwing – support the decision to attack Iran. Among Arab respondents, 11% support and 65% oppose striking Iran.\n\nTo Israelis, Iran is the ultimate, scariest enemy. Since the revolution in 1979, it has been preaching the destruction of the “Zionist regime”. Over the years it built and armed a “ring of fire” around Israel, led by the Lebanese Hezbollah and its arsenal of rockets and missiles. In recent years, Iran and its allies contemplated a plan to destroy Israel through a combination of cross-border invasion and pinpoint missile attacks. But on 7 October Hamas acted alone, enabling Israel to regroup and hit its enemies one by one.\n\nLast autumn, the “ring of fire” collapsed. Israel defeated Hezbollah and killed its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, took out Iran’s key air defences, and watched the Syrian Assad regime, Iran’s oldest regional ally, collapse overnight. Tehran’s skies were now open to Israeli bombers, just like Gaza’s, and rising voices called on Netanyahu to fulfil his lifelong mission and attack Iran – including the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, his apparent rival in the next election.\n\nMilitary opportunity notwithstanding, the turning point in Israel’s war planning was Donald Trump’s second coming to the White House. Netanyahu believed he could extract an unprecedented green light to hit the uranium-enrichment and missile plants in Iran. Israel’s military top brass was reluctant to act without the US consent that had never arrived. With Trump back in office, Netanyahu overcame his doubts. The Americans were aware of the war preparations in Israel. But Trump had bad news for Netanyahu. He opted for negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran, seven years after he had ditched Barack Obama’s agreement under Netanyahu’s prodding. The Israeli leader postponed the operation, only to launch it when Trump’s 60-day deadline to Tehran expired. From Netanyahu’s perspective, Trump’s support for the attack – however lukewarm at first – has been the peak diplomatic achievement of his career.\n\nTo many Israelis, the successful first strike echoed Israel’s greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967. American analysts were quick to declare Israel the new regional hegemon. Even as millions of Israelis were running to their shelters several times a day, Netanyahu and the IDF leadership exuded euphoria, all but eager to erase their 7 October disaster and the Gaza quicksand. They raised high expectations for direct US intervention – needed to destroy Iran’s underground nuclear plant – and for regime change in Tehran, threatening the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBut Netanyahu, who was drafted to IDF special forces shortly after the six-day war, should have known the dire lessons of 1967: bragging leads to complacency, which leads to disaster – as happened in 1973, when Egypt and Syria fought back. Brilliant tactical moves are no guarantee for victory, as they morph into mission creep and indecisive attrition. Israel’s success in rolling back Iran’s nuclear programme is still unclear, but conducting a “war of cities” between Tehran and Tel Aviv will be clearly devastating.\n\nThe first days of his Iranian campaign brought Netanyahu a moment of relief from his political troubles. His corruption trial, where he is facing cross-examination, is postponed. Opposition leaders applauded his decision to attack Iran. And the 7 October reruns and stories about the hostages, constant reminders of Netanyahu’s failure, are off primetime television.\n\nYet true to form, Netanyahu is showing no interest in reconciliation with his real or imaginary rivals. On the contrary, he appears to view his new heroic credentials as a means to double down on his race to turn Israel into a theocratic autocracy, a Hebrew-speaking version of Iran. His critics were hardly surprised when, visiting a bombed hospital in Beersheba, he spoke of his family paying the “cost” of war, having had to postpone his younger son’s wedding. To them it was another example of his condescending detachment from the plight of ordinary Israelis. His critics dismiss the decision to attack Iran as politically motivated and careless. They are a minority, according to a Channel 13 poll released on Wednesday, in which 64% of respondents believed that Netanyahu truly wants to rid Israel of Iran’s nukes and missiles, and only 28% attributed political motives to his war decision. But their support for the destruction of Natanz and Fordow, and even of getting rid of Iran’s rulers, was not translated to an intention to vote for the current coalition, which remains unpopular.\n\nNetanyahu’s vindication, apparently, would take much more than bombing sorties over Iran.",

      "content": "IPOH, June 21 — Perak Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad has expressed hope that the proposal to upgrade the East-West Highway (JRTB) linking Gerik and Jeli will be included in the 13th Malaysia Plan (13MP).\n\nSaarani said the state government had conveyed its intention to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during his visit to Lumut last week.\n\n“What’s most important is to reassess the alignment and widening of the JRTB. The upgrade involves more than just resurfacing; it requires a full reconstruction, as the existing structure is so old that some of the damage has exposed the road base.\n\n“This highway has been in use for over 40 years, and simply patching up damaged sections may no longer be sufficient. However, the state government fully understands that constructing a new alignment or rebuilding the JRTB would require substantial funding,” he said at a press conference after officiating the closing ceremony of the 2025 National Training Week at the Ipoh Convention Centre here today.\n\nSaarani said the state government has also instructed the State Infrastructure, Energy, Water and Public Transport chairman, Datuk Seri Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin, and Human Resources, Health, Indian Community Affairs and National Integration chairman A. Sivanesan, to prepare a report and study on upgrading the JRTB and Gerik Hospital.\n\n“Mohammad Nizar will obtain information and data from the Works Ministry regarding the upgrade of the JRTB, while Sivanesan is working on applying to the Health Ministry for the upgrading of Gerik Hospital, as there is an urgent need in the event of accidents. Typically, victims are taken to Hospital Taiping or the Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital.\n\n“If upgraded, it would be sufficient for patients or victims to be treated at Gerik Hospital, provided it is equipped with the necessary facilities and expertise. Once the study is completed, we will submit a letter to the relevant ministry,” he added.\n\nIn the early hours of June 9, a tragic accident along the JRTB near Tasik Banding, Gerik, claimed the lives of 15 Universiti Perguruan Sultan Idris (UPSI) students when the chartered bus transporting them from Jertih, Terengganu, to the main campus in Tanjong Malim, Perak, was involved in a crash.\n\nThe crash also left 33 others injured, including the bus driver and his assistant, as well as the driver and three passengers of a multi-purpose vehicle. — Bernama",

      "content": "While an embassy presence would have advantages, observers say there are limits to what's possible\n\nNeither Israel nor Iran is backing down from an escalating conflict that has endangered civilians in both countries, and because Canada has no embassy in Iran, Ottawa is having to work from afar to support thousands of Canadian citizens stuck there.\n\nWhile Canada has an embassy in Israel, it severed diplomatic relations with Tehran more than a decade ago.\n\nThough having an embassy presence would provide Canada with certain advantages, analysts and observers say there are limits in what can be done on the ground with so much chaos unfolding.\n\nThat said, Bruce Mabley, a retired diplomat whose postings included stints in the Middle East, says having a diplomatic presence at least allows both countries to potentially talk to one another.\n\n\"It's stupid not to be there,\" he said.\n\nA long way to the border\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada did not respond to questions from CBC News about how the lack of an embassy presence was impacting Ottawa's efforts to support Canadians inside Iran.\n\nBut even if Canada did have an embassy in Tehran right now, that wouldn't change the fact that flights aren't leaving the capital. Both Iran and Israel had closed their airspaces while launching numerous attacks over the last week, though Iran recently allowed an Indian flight to leave from another part of the country, and several more were reportedly expected to follow.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Anita Anand has publicly urged Canadians fleeing both Israel and Iran to head to Jordan, Armenia and Turkey.\n\nBut the journey to neighbouring nations of Turkey or Armenia is a long one for anyone living in the Iranian capital, which is hundreds of kilometres from either of those destinations.\n\n\"The border is really far away,\" said University of Toronto history professor Mohamad Tavakoli-Targhi, who was born in Tehran and has family still in Iran.\n\nHe says the roads out of the Iranian capital have been jammed with people trying to flee, making that route out more difficult.\n\nA tense journey\n\nOne of his students, Hanieh Bakhtiari, recently travelled back to Iran to visit her parents, and the fighting started days after she arrived.\n\nBakhtiari and her partner fled the country on a bus, in a tense, 11-hour journey to Turkey, during which she says she was \"constantly watching\" the skies for potential attacks.\n\n\"We were … very much scared of being attacked while we were on the road,\" said Bakhtiari, who spoke to CBC's As It Happens about her journey out of Iran.\n\nIsrael began a wave of attacks on June 13, targeting Iranian military and nuclear sites with airstrikes that have killed high-ranking Iranian generals and nuclear scientists.\n\nThe Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran says that as of Thursday, at least 657 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks, and of those, at least 263 were civilians.\n\nIran has launched retaliatory strikes, which the Israeli military estimates have involved at least 450 missiles and 1,000 drones. At least two dozen people in Israel have been killed.\n\nThe Israeli push against Iran may draw U.S. involvement, though U.S. President Donald Trump has delayed making a decision.\n\nThe costs of cutting ties\n\nOpinions are split among observers on whether it would be better for Canada to have an embassy in Tehran.\n\n\"Having an embassy in Tehran would not be a panacea,\" said Peter G. Bates, a retired Canadian diplomat who was twice posted to Tehran and helped close the Canadian embassy there in 2012.\n\nPhil Gurski, a former Iran intelligence analyst for Canadian spy agencies, finds himself \"on both sides\" of the debate.\n\nOn one hand, he says there's a point where a line is crossed that cannot be tolerated, but when an embassy gets shut down and ties are cut, \"you're essentially flying blind.\"\n\nGurski says there are other ways for the government to monitor events in Iran — including reviewing information from satellites, the use of signals intelligence, or conferring with friendly embassies about what's unfolding on the ground.\n\nGurski, Mabley and Bates all note that when an embassy is closed, a government will typically ask an ally with an embassy presence in that same region to provide support in its absence.\n\nHowever, any friendly embassy doing favours for Canada will expectedly prioritize the needs of its own citizens first.\n\nAnd as things escalate between Israel and Iran, any such ally may also be getting similar requests from other nations that don't have a diplomatic presence in Tehran.\n\nU of T's Tavakoli-Targhi sees a clear benefit that an embassy provides, beyond giving diplomatic staff better access to citizens abroad.\n\nHe says embassies can serve as a source of hope for people who are \"in a moment of despair,\" like many Canadians living in Tehran at the moment.",

      "title": "This activist spent 4 gruelling days in Israeli custody, but says he&apos;ll try again to bring aid to Gaza",
      "content": "Thiago Avila was on board the aid vessel Madleen when it was intercepted by Israel\n\nAfter four days in Israeli detention, Thiago Avila was relieved to be back in Brazil. He'd been taken into custody, along with 11 others, and spent two days in solitary confinement, after they'd tried to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza by sea. Their vessel, the Madleen, was intercepted leading to what he describes as a gruelling stay marked by inhumane treatment and a brief hunger strike.\n\nAnd yet, he told CBC News from Sao Paulo, he chose to be detained rather than sign documents admitting to what he considered a false accusation — that they had tried to enter Israel illegally.\n\nSome 20 hours after the vessel was intercepted, Avila, 37, says they were taken to shore and crammed into small police vehicles. He says they had not been given access to a bathroom and that one crew member urinated in the police car.\n\n\"It was a very degrading [situation],\" he said.\n\nIsraeli police did not respond to a request for comment on Avila's time in jail.\n\nThey were taken to an immigration facility, he says, where former officers of the Israel Defence Forces demanded he and the others — noted climate activist was Greta Thunberg among them — watch videos of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas against Israel, which sparked the latter's war in Gaza, and a humanitarian crisis therein.\n\nHe says they refused — unless the officer they were speaking to would watch videos of what is taking place in Gaza.\n\n\"I said 'If you don't watch the video of the genocide that you're committing, we don't want to watch the video that you are using to manufacture consent for your genocide,'\" he said.\n\nThe official refused, and the crew were not made to view the videos.\n\nHe says he was asked, again, by an immigration agent, to sign documents that said he'd entered Israel illegally. He would have been deported and banned from the country for 100 years if he signed. He again refused. Avila says the boat was in international waters when it was intercepted.\n\nBut the group agreed that some of them should sign so they could go out and tell the Madleen's story.\n\n\"We didn't want to have no other voice telling the truth about what happened,\" he said.\n\nFour signed and were freed.\n\nThe others were taken to Israel's Givon Prison and placed in separate cells. Avila says the conditions were terrible — little to no access to water, which was darkly coloured; bed bugs that he says led to Scabies; and psychological torment by sleep depravation.\n\n\"They would come every hour or so just to make noise, make everyone get up [and] not be able to sleep,\" he said.\n\nAvila says he was singled out for solitary confinement because he was one of the organizers of the mission and because he'd gone on a hunger and thirst strike.\n\nHe says officers told him that he'd be disciplined and offered him food on multiple occasions — bread, hummus and rice.\n\nAvila says he told them: \"Since you're... denying food to more than two million people in Gaza, how can I accept your food and water?\"\n\nFor months now, aid has all but trickled into Gaza since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was broken in March. But the enclave has been blockaded for years, inspiring missions like the Madleen's bring aid to Gaza. Since 2008, only five boats have been able to make it the strip and sail back successfully.\n\nAvila says his solitary cell was was infested with rats and cockroaches. He says officers became more violent with him, pushing him around and threatening to take him to Gaza and put him in the notorious Sde Teiman jail.\n\nAnd yet, on June 12, Avila was released and put on a flight back to Brazil, to reunite with his wife and daughter.\n\nHe says he's already signed up for the next mission to Gaza.\n\nBefore leaving, he told an Israeli official that they would see each other again \"very soon.\"\n\n\"We continue to have new missions and will not stop until Palestine is free.\"",

      "title": "‘A perfect storm’: multi-club ownership, Crystal Palace and a looming court threat",
      "content": "Uefa’s legal team is preparing for more action as a complex and increasingly common issue rears its head again\n\nIn the waterfront offices of Uefa’s House of European Football headquarters in Nyon, the legal team are preparing for an unwanted trip around Lake Geneva to Lausanne. Over the course of many internal meetings since Crystal Palace inadvertently provided Uefa with the toughest test yet of its multi-club ownership (MCO) rules by winning the FA Cup, it has become increasingly clear the ultimate arbiter on the issue is likely to be the court of arbitration for sport (Cas).\n\n“We’re going to find out if our MCO rules stand up to scrutiny as, one way or another, it looks like we’re going to Cas,” says one source at Uefa, resigned to the issue of whether Palace can compete in next season’s Europa League being placed in the hands of that Lausanne court.\n\nUefa has been liaising closely with Palace, with sources claiming the issue of John Textor’s dual shareholding in the club and Lyon – who qualified for the Europa League by finishing sixth in Ligue 1 – was flagged by the governing body long before the 1 March deadline for resolving MCO issues. The American is in advanced discussions over selling his 44.9% stake in Palace to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, which may help the club’s cause, although there is no prospect of the deal being completed before Uefa has to make a decision.\n\nThe case is emblematic of the confusion surrounding club ownership and the regulatory issues facing the sport, and Uefa has delayed a ruling until the related case of Lyon’s financial problems has been resolved. The DNCG – French football’s financial watchdog – is auditing Lyon’s accounts after imposing a provisional relegation to Ligue 2 last year owing to the club’s debt levels, with a final outcome expected next week. Relegation and a ban from European competition for Lyon would make Uefa’s life a lot easier, although both seem unlikely.\n\n“It’s a perfect storm,” says a sympathetic figure at another club. “Everything that could go wrong from Uefa’s point of view has done. We have three clubs involved [Palace, Lyon and Brøndby, who are owned by the Palace shareholder David Blitzer], and two multi-club groups. There’s a complex ownership group at Palace who don’t appear to communicate very well, and a surprise FA Cup winner. Not to mention Lyon’s financial issues. You couldn’t make it up really.”\n\nPalace sources acknowledge they are working with Uefa amid belief on both sides that an accommodation is wanted, but two factors beyond either party’s control could count against them.\n\nFirst, Cas last month upheld Fifa’s decision to expel the Mexican club León from the Club World Cup because they are part of the same ownership group as another qualifier, Pachuca. The owner, Grupo Pachuca, had attempted to park its León shareholding in a separate trust but this move did not satisfy Fifa or Cas.\n\nIn another complication Nottingham Forest, who will be moved from the Conference League to the Europa League if Palace are kicked out, may go to Cas if denied that promotion. A source close to Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, told the Guardian the Greek billionaire was opposed to many of the moves to regulate football and was prepared to take on Uefa. There are clear financial incentives to do so. Whereas Chelsea earned £21m in prize money from winning the Conference League in the past season, Tottenham’s Europa League triumph could be worth well over £100m because it also delivered a Champions League place.\n\nPalace are worried the León ruling has set a precedent that could work against them. At Uefa there is a feeling that it would rather face Forest at Cas than have its multi-club framework tested in court by Palace.\n\nOne figure at a European team with direct experience of multi-club contortions believes Uefa will give Palace every opportunity to pass muster, concurring that the governing body’s regulations could be brought tumbling down in the event Textor and company mounted a challenge. An examination brought about by Forest would, they suggested, give the existing rules a far better chance of holding firm.\n\nConfirmation by Cas this week of the League of Ireland side Drogheda’s expulsion from the Conference League owing to a multi-club breach has heightened concerns in Nyon, but the cases are different. Drogheda had qualified by winning the Irish Cup last November yet their owner, Trivela Group, failed to meet Uefa’s March deadline, and unlike Textor the American investors are majority owners of two clubs: Drogheda and Denmark’s Silkeborg.\n\nUefa had caused disquiet in some quarters by shifting that deadline forward from last year’s June date. Some figures involved in club acquisition have expressed surprise that Drogheda were not able to win their case at Cas.\n\n“Uefa are trying to be flexible, but the Fifa v Club León case is making it harder for them,” a source said. “Cas upheld Fifa’s rules, which are very similar to Uefa’s, so the precedent is there. The Cas ruling was based on the nature of the blind trust and the importance of the regulatory process – ie dates and deadlines. To put it simply Palace haven’t complied, but Uefa want to make it work.”\n\nThere is some acknowledgment at Uefa that elements of its MCO rules are not fit for purpose, although it would prefer to redraft them in Nyon than put them at the mercy of the court. There is nothing in Article 5 of Uefa’s rules detailing whether Palace or Brøndby should be given precedence if both end up in next season’s Conference League, for example. In ordinary circumstances it would be Brøndby by virtue of their higher league position, as stated in the rules, but Palace could also have a claim if parachuted in from the more prestigious Europa League.\n\nUefa’s MCO rules have been in place without many revisions for 24 years, although one significant change was made 12 months ago when the regulations were relaxed to permit a club part of a multi-ownership group to compete in a different competition.\n\nArticle 5 was drafted in 2001 after a legal challenge from Tottenham’s owner, Enic, the first multi-club operation in the Premier League, after AEK Athens were blocked from taking part in the 1998-99 Uefa Cup because their sister club Slavia Prague had also qualified. The initial rule stated that “control or influence” over more than one club was not allowed, but it was not tested until 2017 when RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg qualified for the Champions League, which led to the wording being altered to “decisive influence”.\n\nWhat had been a rare occurrence is now an annual problem for Uefa, with Aston Villa, Brighton and Toulouse allowed to play in Europe during the 2023-24 season only when their owners put more distance between them and Vitória de Guimarães, Union Saint-Gilloise and Milan respectively. The same issue affected Manchester City and Girona as well as Manchester United and Nice a year later.\n\nThe fact that neither Girona nor Manchester United joined their partner clubs in qualifying for next season’s European competitions may have kicked a further conundrum down the road. Their respective ownership groups were allowed what was, in theory, a short-term exemption last season by placing one of their clubs’ shares in a blind trust until 1 July this year. One club owner wonders how Uefa would have responded if those sides had reached the same tournament for a second consecutive year. It is unclear whether they would have been allowed to roll over into a further 12 months of blind trust holding.\n\nMulti-club ownership is growing constantly; figures shared with the Guardian by the MCO Insights consultancy suggest more than 800 top- and second-tier clubs could be involved by 2030. That would roughly double the current number. By that point it would surely be uncontrollable by current rules. Simon Leaf, head of sport at the law firm Mishcon de Reya, believes Uefa and other governing bodies need clearer regulations to avoid being repeatedly taken to court.\n\n“We are seeing an increasing number of clubs looking to use various legal avenues – in particular, competition law – to try to challenge regulations that they dislike,” Leaf says. “This trend is likely to continue, making it much harder for leagues and governing bodies to regulate their competitions.\n\n“On the Palace matter it is hard to have too much sympathy with Uefa given they already showed themselves to be willing to bend their own rules on MCOs last summer – and despite their efforts to strengthen the regulations since then, the bar has now been set.\n\n“Either way, MCOs are not going away, and so football’s governing bodies need to find a way to properly deal with these issues so that they are dealt with in the boardroom rather than the courtroom.”",

      "content": "WASHINGTON, June 21 — A 19-year-old man who pleaded guilty to one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in US history has agreed to testify against Singaporean national Malone Lam, who is accused of masterminding a sprawling digital crime ring that stole over US$260 million.\n\nAccording to Channel News Asia, Veer Chetal admitted in a plea deal to conspiracy charges involving fraud and money laundering linked to the theft of 4,100 bitcoins from a Washington, DC, crypto holder in August 2024. The stolen coins were valued at around US$245 million (RM1 billion) at the time.\n\nUnsealed court documents revealed that Chetal agreed in November last year to cooperate with federal authorities and testify against his co-defendants, including 20-year-old Lam. Chetal, who was a Rutgers University student at the time, now faces up to 24 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Lam was not only involved in the US$245 million theft but allegedly spearheaded a 13-member criminal ring that operated globally, targeting crypto wallets using “social engineering” attacks. Members posed as tech support staff from companies like Google and Yahoo to trick victims into handing over access credentials.\n\nThe group is believed to have met on online gaming platforms, where they bonded before launching their sophisticated scheme. In May, Lam was charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act in connection with the wider conspiracy. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nFederal prosecutors describe Lam as one of the ring’s two leaders. Despite being arrested last September, he allegedly continued directing operations from jail — including instructing members to purchase and deliver luxury goods to his girlfriend in Miami.\n\nAuthorities say Lam personally benefited from the crimes, reportedly spending up to US$500,000 in a single night at clubs and amassing at least 28 luxury cars, some valued at US$3.8 million. He also rented high-end properties in Los Angeles, Miami, and the Hamptons, and spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing.\n\nLam’s lawyer, Scott Armstrong, has said the Singaporean “looks forward to exercising his right to trial by jury,” with proceedings set to begin in October.\n\nChetal’s guilty plea has brought further revelations. Prosecutors now allege he was linked to about 50 other crypto thefts totalling US$3 million between November 2023 and September 2024.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin theft, Chetal’s parents were kidnapped in a botched ransom plot in Connecticut by six men who believed he still controlled large amounts of cryptocurrency. The attack failed thanks to witnesses and an off-duty FBI agent nearby.\n\nThe teen’s assets, including over US$39 million in cryptocurrency, luxury watches, clothing, and US$500,000 in cash, have since been seized by federal agents. He is also facing possible deportation.",

      "title": "Iran is the enemy Netanyahu has always wanted to destroy. Even from their bomb shelters, most Israelis support his war",
      "content": "Within Israel, Iran is seen as the ultimate threat. The prime minister knows this is his chance to rewrite his bloodied legacy\n\n“It’s 1938 and Iran is Germany … The Jewish people will not allow a second Holocaust.” Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, recited slogans like these incessantly for decades, urging action against the gravest threat to the Jewish state – a nuclear-armed Iran. He conveyed the message to successive US presidents. He presented a bomb cartoon at the UN. At countless Holocaust memorial events he described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as the present-day “final solution”.\n\nNetanyahu talked and talked about the pressing Iranian threat, but his listeners were not convinced. They dismissed him as an alarmist whose deadline Iran crossed year after year without deploying a nuclear weapon (it still hasn’t). Netanyahu’s critics at home taunted him as a chicken who would never dare to attack Iran’s nuclear installations – unlike his more decisive predecessors, who had ordered the bombing of nuclear reactors in Iraq and Syria.\n\nEverything changed on Friday 13 June.\n\nAt 3am local time, Israelis were woken by an urgent alert from the Home Front Command, ordering us to stay near our safe rooms or bomb shelters. Shortly after, an official announcement told us that Israel had attacked Iran’s nuclear plants and air defences, and assassinated its top military brass and nuclear scientists. When the night came, a barrage of Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv and its outskirts. The exchanges of bombs, drones and missiles have continued ever since, causing more than 260 civilian deaths in Iran and 24 in Israel, and inflicting considerable damage.\n\nTo Netanyahu and his followers, 13 June is the big vindication. An opportunity to rewrite his legacy, which has been marred by his failure to prevent the disaster of 7 October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping 250 hostages to Gaza, and igniting a devastating war that is still going on. The prime minister ignored warnings of imminent war while pushing autocracy, then blamed the security services, spreading excuses and conspiracy theories only his diehard supporters believed.\n\nThe ensuing Gaza war did little to boost Netanyahu’s leadership credentials. Even after Israel had killed more than 55,000 Palestinians it failed to achieve the “ultimate victory” pledged by the prime minister. Hamas, however decimated, is still in charge, and 53 Israeli hostages – 20 of them believed to be alive – are still in captivity. To many around the world, Netanyahu’s name is synonymous with mass murder. Even in Israel, anti-war sentiment began to rise after he broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March.\n\nAttacking Iran, however, is far more consensual in Israel. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute released on Thursday showed 82% of Jewish respondents – including 57% who consider themselves leftwing – support the decision to attack Iran. Among Arab respondents, 11% support and 65% oppose striking Iran.\n\nTo Israelis, Iran is the ultimate, scariest enemy. Since the revolution in 1979, it has been preaching the destruction of the “Zionist regime”. Over the years it built and armed a “ring of fire” around Israel, led by the Lebanese Hezbollah and its arsenal of rockets and missiles. In recent years, Iran and its allies contemplated a plan to destroy Israel through a combination of cross-border invasion and pinpoint missile attacks. But on 7 October Hamas acted alone, enabling Israel to regroup and hit its enemies one by one.\n\nLast autumn, the “ring of fire” collapsed. Israel defeated Hezbollah and killed its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, took out Iran’s key air defences, and watched the Syrian Assad regime, Iran’s oldest regional ally, collapse overnight. Tehran’s skies were now open to Israeli bombers, just like Gaza’s, and rising voices called on Netanyahu to fulfil his lifelong mission and attack Iran – including the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, his apparent rival in the next election.\n\nMilitary opportunity notwithstanding, the turning point in Israel’s war planning was Donald Trump’s second coming to the White House. Netanyahu believed he could extract an unprecedented green light to hit the uranium-enrichment and missile plants in Iran. Israel’s military top brass was reluctant to act without the US consent that had never arrived. With Trump back in office, Netanyahu overcame his doubts. The Americans were aware of the war preparations in Israel. But Trump had bad news for Netanyahu. He opted for negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran, seven years after he had ditched Barack Obama’s agreement under Netanyahu’s prodding. The Israeli leader postponed the operation, only to launch it when Trump’s 60-day deadline to Tehran expired. From Netanyahu’s perspective, Trump’s support for the attack – however lukewarm at first – has been the peak diplomatic achievement of his career.\n\nTo many Israelis, the successful first strike echoed Israel’s greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967. American analysts were quick to declare Israel the new regional hegemon. Even as millions of Israelis were running to their shelters several times a day, Netanyahu and the IDF leadership exuded euphoria, all but eager to erase their 7 October disaster and the Gaza quicksand. They raised high expectations for direct US intervention – needed to destroy Iran’s underground nuclear plant – and for regime change in Tehran, threatening the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBut Netanyahu, who was drafted to IDF special forces shortly after the six-day war, should have known the dire lessons of 1967: bragging leads to complacency, which leads to disaster – as happened in 1973, when Egypt and Syria fought back. Brilliant tactical moves are no guarantee for victory, as they morph into mission creep and indecisive attrition. Israel’s success in rolling back Iran’s nuclear programme is still unclear, but conducting a “war of cities” between Tehran and Tel Aviv will be clearly devastating.\n\nThe first days of his Iranian campaign brought Netanyahu a moment of relief from his political troubles. His corruption trial, where he is facing cross-examination, is postponed. Opposition leaders applauded his decision to attack Iran. And the 7 October reruns and stories about the hostages, constant reminders of Netanyahu’s failure, are off primetime television.\n\nYet true to form, Netanyahu is showing no interest in reconciliation with his real or imaginary rivals. On the contrary, he appears to view his new heroic credentials as a means to double down on his race to turn Israel into a theocratic autocracy, a Hebrew-speaking version of Iran. His critics were hardly surprised when, visiting a bombed hospital in Beersheba, he spoke of his family paying the “cost” of war, having had to postpone his younger son’s wedding. To them it was another example of his condescending detachment from the plight of ordinary Israelis. His critics dismiss the decision to attack Iran as politically motivated and careless. They are a minority, according to a Channel 13 poll released on Wednesday, in which 64% of respondents believed that Netanyahu truly wants to rid Israel of Iran’s nukes and missiles, and only 28% attributed political motives to his war decision. But their support for the destruction of Natanz and Fordow, and even of getting rid of Iran’s rulers, was not translated to an intention to vote for the current coalition, which remains unpopular.\n\nNetanyahu’s vindication, apparently, would take much more than bombing sorties over Iran.",
